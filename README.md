# Text Generation with Markov Chains

This project implements a simple yet effective text generation system using Markov Chains. By analyzing the statistical relationships between words or characters, the model learns to predict the next element in a sequence based on prior context. This technique enables the generation of new, stylistically consistent text that mimics the structure of the original dataset. Itâ€™s a lightweight and interpretable approach to text generation, ideal for exploring probabilistic language models and building creative content generators.
